            Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the
            acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and
            habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
            storytelling, discussion and directed research. ... The methodology
            of teaching is called pedagogy.

          Education designed to support early development in preparation for
          participation in school and society. The programmes are designed for
          children below the age of 3.Preschools provide education from ages
          approximately three to seven, depending on the country when children
          enter primary education. The children now readily interact with their
          peers and the educator. These are also known as nursery schools and as
          kindergarten, except in the US, where the term kindergarten refers to
          the earliest levels of primary education. Kindergarten "provides a
          child-centred, preschool curriculum for three- to seven-year-old
          children that aim[s] at unfolding the child's physical, intellectual,
          and moral nature with balanced emphasis on each of them."

          Primary (or elementary) education consists of the first four to seven
          years of formal, structured education. In general, primary education
          consists of six to eight years of schooling starting at the age of
          five to seven, although this varies between, and sometimes within,
          countries. Globally, in 2008, around 89% of children aged six to
          twelve were enrolled in primary education, and this proportion was
          rising. Under the Education For All programs driven by UNESCO, most
          countries have committed to achieving universal enrollment in primary
          education by 2015, and in many countries, it is compulsory. The
          division between primary and secondary education is somewhat
          arbitrary, but it generally occurs at about eleven or twelve years of
          age. Some education systems have separate middle schools, with the
          transition to the final stage of secondary education taking place at
          around the age of fifteen. Schools that provide primary education, are
          mostly referred to as primary schools or elementary schools. Primary
          schools are often subdivided into infant schools and junior schools.

          In most contemporary educational systems of the world, secondary
          education comprises the formal education that occurs during
          adolescence. In the United States, Canada, and Australia, primary and
          secondary education together are sometimes referred to as K-12
          education, and in New Zealand Year 1â€“13 is used. The purpose of
          secondary education can be to give common knowledge, to prepare for
          higher education, or to train directly in a profession.Secondary
          education in the United States did not emerge until 1910, with the
          rise of large corporations and advancing technology in factories,
          which required skilled workers. In order to meet this new job demand,
          high schools were created, with a curriculum focused on practical job
          skills that would better prepare students for white collar or skilled
          blue collar work. This proved beneficial for both employers and
          employees, since the improved human capital lowered costs for the
          employer, while skilled employees received higher wages.
